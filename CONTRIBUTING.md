# Contributing to dsh-maestro-review

Thank you for contributing to **dsh-maestro-review** (`@ddtcorex/dsh-maestro-review`) — the pluggable ReviewProvider (GitLab/GitHub) + orchestrator for automated MR review in DeepSeek Harness.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone** `github.com/ddtcorex/dsh-maestro-review`.
2. Install dependencies (requires Node.js 20+, pnpm 10+):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the plugin (TypeScript → `lib/`):

   ```bash
   pnpm build        # runs tsc
   ```

4. Open the project in your editor. Key layout:

   ```
   src/               # host + client plugin source
   src/providers/     # ReviewProvider contract + GitLab/GitHub implementations
   presets/           # reviewer/auditor agent presets
   client/            # browser bundle source
   cordis.patch.yml   # Cordis rows: maestro-review-webhook / orchestrator / settings-rpc
   tests/             # vitest suites
   ```

## Workflow

This repository follows the workspace Superpowers workflow described in `AGENTS.md` for any non-trivial change:

1. **brainstorming** — explore intent, requirements, and design before writing code.
2. **writing-plans** — turn the approved design into a task-by-task plan with exact test and implementation sketches. Plans are transient — delete them once the batch ships.
3. **executing-plans** — implement task by task with strict **TDD**: write a failing test first, verify RED, implement, verify GREEN, then commit that task before starting the next. Do not commit while tests are red.

For small single-file fixes, a focused PR with tests still applies. Describe durable outcomes in the PR body.

## Branch Naming

Never commit directly to `master`. Start a feature branch per work session:

- `fix/<topic>` — bug fixes
- `feat/<topic>` — new features (new provider, orchestrator change, client UI)
- `docs/<topic>` — documentation-only changes

Rebase (not merge) when the base moves: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master`.

## Conventional Commits

All commit subjects **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in imperative mood:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body — why, not what>

Refs: #<issue>
```

- **Types (closed list):** `feat` `fix` `docs` `chore` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci` `revert`
- **Scope:** optional, without the `dsh-maestro-` prefix — e.g. `feat(review):`, `fix(orchestrator):`, `docs(readme):`
- **Subject:** imperative, lowercase first word, ≤ 72 chars, no trailing period
- **Body:** explain *why* and trade-offs when non-trivial
- **Breaking changes:** `feat!: <subject>` plus a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

One TDD task = one commit while executing a plan; squash at merge time if the history reads better squashed.

## Validation

Run these before opening a PR (match depth to risk):

```bash
pnpm verify      # typecheck — tsc --noEmit
pnpm test        # vitest run
pnpm build       # tsc — ensures lib/ is not stale
```

After client changes, also rebuild the browser bundle:

```bash
pnpm run build:client  # browser bundle -> lib/client.js (if script exists)
```

Do not claim verified/done/clean without having actually run the checks — be ready to paste exact command output in the PR.

## Pull Requests

1. Push your branch and open a PR into `master`.
2. Fill out `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (Summary, Why, Changes, Validation, Linked Issues).
3. Link the PR to the plan that produced it when the Superpowers workflow was used.
4. Ensure CI (`pnpm verify` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` via `dsh-maestro-ci`) is green.

## Package Visibility

This package is public (`"private": false` — field omitted would also default to public, but we set it explicitly). Never set `"private": true` in `package.json`. Publishing uses `pnpm publish --access public` only — never `npm publish` (would leave `workspace:` in the tarball).

Verify before publish:

```bash
grep '"private": false' package.json
pnpm publish --dry-run 2>&1 | grep -q "workspace:" && echo "FAIL workspace left" || echo "OK"
```
