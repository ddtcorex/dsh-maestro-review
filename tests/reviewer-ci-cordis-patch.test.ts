/**
 * Preset delivery, end to end across the three files that have to agree.
 *
 * The orchestrator mounts presets by id (`agentPresets.mount(agentCtx,
 * 'dsh-maestro-reviewer')`). On DSH 0.1.7 the registry resolves ids from loader
 * rows naming `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` — `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset-registry`
 * injects `['loader', 'sessionProjections']`, and no package in the 0.1.7 tree
 * reads `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets` any more (verified 2026-09-24 by grepping
 * every package's `src/`, and by running the retired provider's
 * `discoverPresets()` against a temp home, which was the only thing that found
 * them). The retired plural `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets` is therefore gone
 * from the profile, and the declarations ship inside the plugin bundle instead:
 * `dsh.bundle.patch` lists the two preset patch files, so every profile that
 * composes the bundle — headless CI and the web app alike — gets the rows
 * without copying a directory anywhere.
 *
 * Get any one of the three out of step and the failure is silent until a real
 * review runs: no provider row means the service never exists, a missing patch
 * file means the preset id resolves to nothing, and a profile that re-`insert`s
 * an id the bundle already declares fails the boot with a duplicate entry.
