/**
 * The producer-owned source kind this plugin stamps on every message it injects
 * into a review session.
 *
 * Session format v4 requires the producer to name itself (`plugin:<package>`)
 * and rejects the retired bare `kind: 'plugin'`. `kind: 'user'` is admissible
 * but false: these prompts are machine-initiated, and consumers classify a turn
 * by this kind — dsh-maestro-memory's write guard documents that
 * plugin-initiated turns carry no per-turn write duty.
 *
 * The reviewer and auditor sessions keep their own explicit
 * `sessionTitle.rename(...)`: the harness only auto-titles a `kind: 'user'`
 * message, so a plugin-attributed prompt feeds no title.
